I created an Coming Soon Page as part of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0) challenge. A simple layout for an cooming soon page with a responsive design and an interactive email input that validates the correct email format.
